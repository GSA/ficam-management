A communication’s plan should be created early in the program life cycle in order to communicate with users and stakeholders consistently and effectively. A communication’s plan will outline the objectives, goals, themes and approach of the overall program.

We’ve provided a summary of some common communications that should be included in an ICAM program below.


| <center> Communication Description </center> | <center> Target Audience </center> | <center> Delivery Media </center> |
|----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------:|:---------:|
| ICAM program awareness materials explaining key program features and milestones | User population | Brochures, posters, videos |
| ICAM program website containing resources for stakeholders and users | Various stakeholder groups | Website |
| Ad hoc updates for system rollout events and changes | User population | E-mail, newsletter bulletin |
| Leadership briefing highlighting program objectives and status | Agency Leadership | Slide presentation, meeting |
| Lessons learned workshops | ICAM implementers | Meeting, teleconference, webinar |
| Messages from Leadership | ICAM implementers | Memo, email |
| ICAM conference or All-Hands | ICAM implementers, user population | Meeting, teleconference, webinar |

Agencies should analyze the stakeholders that make up their audience and tailor the message and delivery method in such a way that will produce the desired response. The goal of this plan is to keep stakeholders regularly informed and involved by providing appropriate and well-structured communications, ultimately helping to foster and maintain stakeholder support and reduce risk..

As many agencies learned when introducing the new PIV credential, employees and contractors needed to be made aware of the new requirements, processes, and their benefits before enrollments started to increase." %}
