A stakeholder is an individual or organization that is either actively involved in a program or who might be affected by the program’s execution or completion. It’s critical to identify all stakeholders, and not just those who may be positively affected by the project, in order to understand the needs, responsibilities, and potential impacts of program decisions. We’ve identified key ICAM stakeholders at the federal and agency level for consideration. This list is not exhaustive and agencies will need to identify the unique stakeholders for their mission delivery.
