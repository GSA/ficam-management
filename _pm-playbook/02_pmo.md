After you have set up the ICAM governance structure, you will need to establish support for the execution and operations of the projects and work streams. This section examines a Program Management Office (PMO) as an option.

An ICAM PMO serves a complementary role to the ESC. Establishing both an ESC and a PMO may not be strictly necessary. However, larger agencies may see the need to separate governance and operational responsibility. A PMO helps ensure that the individual projects and investments that comprise the ICAM program operate efficiently and achieve the expected results within the defined budgetary and schedule constraints.

The PMO will typically be responsible for the following functions: 	

* Planning and coordinating implementation efforts across ICAM stakeholders and component programs. For example:
>* Identity management
>* Credentialing
>* Access management: physical access control systems (PACS)
>* Access management: application access
>* Personnel security
* Maintaining an enterprise ICAM perspective to ensure alignment of all component programs with organizational objectives
* Serving as a centralized point of contact for ICAM questions, issues, and concerns
* Planning for and securing program funding to execute ICAM capabilities
* Handling communications and outreach to both internal and external stakeholders
* Managing program risks and issues to resolution across agency office/component/bureau boundaries

### Establish PMO Governance Structure

PMOs generally follow standardized project management policies, processes, and methods. Within ICAM, a PMO provides opportunities to share lessons learned both within an agency and across agencies. It may serve as an advisor to other agency offices or programs impacted by the ICAM program on addressing ICAM as appropriate within other agency-wide capabilities. An ICAM PMO acts as a single, centralized point of contact for the agency‘s ICAM program. The PMO is the primary authority for performing acquisition planning tasks and making procurement decisions.

The figure below represents a sample ICAM PMO structure. An agency should design its ICAM PMO structure in a way that fosters communication, coordinates efforts, and appropriately aligns with the agency‘s overall organizational structure.
