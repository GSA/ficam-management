<h3><p><i> "Establishing effective ICAM governance is an important part of the federal government's continual efforts to promote robust cybersecurity."</i></p></h3>

</blockquote>

Agencies should create and assign a specific group the responsibility to provide oversight, management, development, and enforcement of agency-specific policies, processes, and performance measures. You can find recommendations on how to establish a formal governance structure within your agency below.

* [Create an Executive Steering Committee (ESC)](#create-an-executive-steering-committee-esc)
* [Establish Bureau/Component Governance](#establish-bureaucomponent-governance)
* [Authorities to Consider](#authorities-to-consider)

### Create an Executive Steering Committee (ESC)

The ESC is chartered by the agency’s executive leadership to govern and align ICAM services and management with your agency’s mission.

An Executive Steering Committee should have personnel representing:

* Chief Information Office
* Chief Security Office
*	Human Resources
*	General Counsel
*	Senior Agency Office for Privacy
*	Mission business owners

The ESC‘s charter should specify the group‘s authority to enforce changes, when necessary, to align ICAM technology, policy and execution with the agency‘s overall mission.

#### ESC Roles and Responsibilities

The roles and responsibilities of each agency‘s ESC are usually governed by its charter. The list below describes some of the ESC’s responsibilities:

* Create and approve a process that ensures the review of ICAM program changes and the resolution of disputes between ICAM and individual program offices
* Provide direction and counsel to the ICAM Program Management Office (PMO)
* Ensure proper resource allocation to ICAM programs and projects
* Review and approve the program business architecture
* Provide input for, or participate in, the critical development stages of the ICAM program
* Take responsibility for overall stakeholder management to include internal agency, other federal agencies, and non-federal stakeholders
* Provide strategic guidance for cost, schedule, performance, and technical solutions to ensure program success
* Review post-implementation evaluations to ensure that forecasted benefits and outcomes of the ICAM services and programs are met
* Provide program status information to oversight organizations, such as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Inspector General (OIG), and Government Accountability Office (GAO), upon request
* Establish collaboration to provide guidance, identify common agency challenges, identify best practices, and share solutions

### Establish Bureau/Component Governance

The bureau/component interdisciplinary team provides ICAM-related recommendations to the department‘s ESC to help drive the success of the ICAM program. These teams are usually comprised of ICAM-related program managers and Information Technology experts who play an important role in creating a bottom up approach for driving successful ICAM capability implementation. These groups provide the ESC with:

* Risk strategies and mitigation by providing insight and business context into the feasibility of implementation
* Insights and lessons learned on the impact that certain decisions may have on program executors
* Enhanced communication and cohesion to achieve buy-in across the enterprise

### Authorities to Consider

Agencies can leverage the following authorities when establishing ICAM governance and designating roles and responsibilities across an agency enterprise.

#### Executive Order (EO) 13800 – Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure:

[EO 13800](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-executive-order-strengthening-cybersecurity-federal-networks-critical-infrastructure/){:target="blank"} provides requirements for strengthening the cybersecurity of federal networks, including holding agency heads accountable for managing cybersecurity risk to their enterprises.

#### Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA):

[FITARA](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ291/PLAW-113publ291.pdf#page=148%5D){:target="blank"}, a U.S. law passed in December 2014, gives Federal agency CIOs significant roles in IT investments including; annual and multi-year planning, budgeting, reporting, management, governance, and oversight functions.
