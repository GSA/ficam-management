Per M-18-XX, "Establishing effective ICAM governance is an important part of the federal government's continual efforts to promote robust cybersecurity." Recommendations on how to establish a formal governance structure with your agency have been provided below. Remember, you must create and assign a specific group the responsibility to provide oversight, management, development, and enforcement of agency-specific policies, processes, and performance measures.

* [Create an Executive Steering Committee (ESC)](#create-an-executive-steering-committee-esc)
* [Establish Bureau/Component Governance](#establish-bureaucomponent-governance)
* [Authorities to Consider](#authorities-to-consider)

## Create an Executive Steering Committee (ESC)

The ESC is chartered by the agency’s executive leadership to govern and align the ICAM program with your agency’s mission. M-18-XX states that, "Agencies shall designate an integrated ICAM office, team, or other governance structure in support of its Enterprise Risk Management capability that includes personnel from the offices of the Chief Information Officer, Chief Security Officer, Human Resources, General Counsel, Senior Agency Official for Privacy, and component organizations that manage ICAM programs and capabilities." The ESC‘s charter should specify the group‘s authority to enforce changes, when necessary, to align ICAM technology, policy and execution with the agency‘s overall mission.

### ESC Roles and Responsibilities

The roles and responsibilities of each agency‘s ESC are usually governed by its charter. The list below describes some of the ESC’s responsibilities:

* Create and approve a process that ensures the review of ICAM program changes and the resolution of disputes between ICAM and individual program offices
* Provide direction and counsel to the ICAM Program Management Office (PMO)
* Ensure proper resource allocation to ICAM programs and projects
* Review and approve the program business architecture
* Provide input for, or participate in, the critical development stages of the ICAM program
* Take responsibility for overall stakeholder management to include internal and external stakeholders
* Provide strategic guidance for cost, schedule, performance, and technical solutions to ensure program success
* Review post-implementation evaluations to ensure that forecasted benefits and outcomes of the ICAM program are met
* Provide program status information to oversight organizations, such as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Inspector General (OIG), and Government Accountability Office (GAO), upon request
* Establish collaboration to provide guidance, identify common agency challenges, identify best practices, and share solutions

## Establish Bureau/Component Governance

The bureau/component interdisciplinary team provides ICAM-related recommendations to the department‘s ESC to help drive the success of the ICAM program. These teams are usually comprised of ICAM-related Program Managers and technical subject matter specialists who play an important role in creating a bottom up approach for driving successful ICAM capability implementation. These groups provide the ESC with:

* Risk mitigation by providing insight and mission context into the feasibility of implementation
* Insights and lessons learned on the impact that certain decisions may have on program executors
* Enhanced communication and cohesion to achieve buy-in across the enterprise

## Authorities to Consider

When establishing ICAM governance and designating roles and responsibilities across an agency enterprise, there are multiple authority’s agencies can leverage to drive more integration. Those authorities include:

### Executive Order 13800 – Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure:

[Executive Order 13800 - Section 1, b, v](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-executive-order-strengthening-cybersecurity-federal-networks-critical-infrastructure/){:target="blank"}, states, “Affective risk management requires agency heads to lead integrated teams of senior executives with expertise in IT, security, budgeting, acquisition, law, privacy, and human resources.”

### Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA):

“Requires the heads of selected agencies to ensure that their respective chief information officers (CIOs) have a significant role in information technology (IT) decisions, including annual and multi-year planning, programming, budgeting, execution, reporting, management, governance, and oversight functions.” The act was released to reduce duplicative and wasteful IT spending.

OMB Memorandum [M-15-14](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2015/m-15-14.pdf){:target="blank"} provides implementation guidance for FITARA and specifies multiple objectives for the memorandum including, to "assist agencies in establishing an inclusive governance process that will enable effective planning, programming, budgeting, and execution for IT resources."
