The Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) Executive Steering Committee (ESC) governs your ICAM projects and workstreams and aligns ICAM services and management with your agency's mission. The agency's executive leadership will charter the ESC.

An ICAM ESC should include the following personnel:

- Chief Information Officer (CIO)
- Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
- Chief Security Officer (CSO)
- Chief Data Officer (CDO)
- Human Resources (HR)
- General Counsel
- Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO)
- Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)
- Senior Agency Official for Physical Security (SAOPS)
- Agency component organizations that manage ICAM programs and capabilities

The ESC charter should specify the group's authority to enforce changes, when necessary, to align ICAM technology, policy, and execution with your agency's overall mission.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Create a charter to govern the roles and responsibilities of your ESC. The ESC is typically responsible for the following functions:

- Review and approve the program business architecture.
- Ensure proper resource allocation to ICAM programs and projects.
- Provide input for, or participate in, the critical development stages of the ICAM program.
- Provide strategic guidance for cost, schedule, performance, and technical solutions to ensure program success.
- Provide direction and counsel to the ICAM Program Management Office (PMO).
- Establish cross-team collaboration to provide guidance, identify common agency challenges, establish best practices, and share solutions.
- Take responsibility for overall stakeholder management, including stakeholders inside the agency, in other federal agencies, and outside the federal government.
- Create and approve a process to review ICAM program changes and resolve disputes between ICAM and individual program offices.
- Report on program status to oversight organizations, such as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Inspector General (OIG), and Government Accountability Office (GAO).
- Review post-implementation evaluations to ensure that ICAM services and programs meet forecasted benefits and outcomes.

## Component Governance

A component agency's interdisciplinary team is usually comprised of the agency's ICAM-related program managers and information technology (IT) experts. This team's purpose is to provide ICAM-related recommendations to the ESC to help drive the ICAM program's success via a bottom-up approach.

These groups leverage their experience and business context to provide the steering committee with strategies, insights, and lessons learned around the following subjects:

- Risk management and mitigation.
- Impact of decisions on program executors.
- Improved buy-in across the agency.
