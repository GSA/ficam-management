All programs that collect, retain, or use personal information are required to complete and maintain program documents to support these activities. Below are processes that agencies must complete in order to meet key privacy requirements:

**System of Records Notice (SORN)** 
<br>

A notice published by an agency in the Federal Register to notify the public of a system of record, a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier assigned to the individual. The SORN includes basic information about the system, including system name, categories of individuals covered by the system, and categories of records in the system and addresses the policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disposing of records in the system.

**Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)**
<br>

The process used to evaluate the potential ramifications to the protection of privacy within IT systems. The resulting document includes information related to the data in the system, access to the data, attributes of the data, and maintenance of administrative controls for protecting it. An agency must complete a PIA whenever a new system is being introduced or an existing system is substantially modified.

**Establishment of Redress Procedures**
<br>

Procedures to allow an individual to review his record in an IT system upon request and permit the individual to request amendment of a record pertaining to him. In addition to enabling an agency to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, redress procedures also help enhance transparency, raise the awareness of the mission, and promote user confidence.

|--------------------------------|
| It is encouraged that ICAM implementers provide redress mechanisms even when not required by the Privacy Act. Allowing users to file complaints and comments regarding an ICAM program and rectify this if their information is inaccurate, lost, or compromised will promote confidence in their interaction with the government. |
