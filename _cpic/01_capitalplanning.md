The main product of the Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process is the Exhibit 300, a document explaining the capital asset plan and business case. Your agency will write and review Exhibit 300s annually for both new and existing capital investments. The following sections describe the areas your agency will need to consider to construct an Exhibit 300.

## Update Agency Approach to ICAM Investment

Traditionally, some agencies submit separate Exhibit 300 investment requests for various Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) activities, such as HSPD-12 or E-authentication. In future budget submissions, you should consider coordinating your capital planning efforts across ICAM projects and Exhibit 300 business cases. This coordination aligns projects to reduce redundant ICAM investments across agency components or bureaus.

## Include ICAM Requirements in CPIC Processes

First, identify key criteria that align investments with Federal ICAM (FICAM) policy. Communicate any changes to the relevant stakeholders and CPIC process participants.

The following list includes things you should consider in each phase of the standard CPIC process.

- **Preselect.** Assess the business needs and resource requirements for the investment. Investment business plans should state use of the PIV card or authentication within the security planning and educate the Investment Review Board on ICAM requirements.
- **Select.** Select investments that best support the mission and approach. Review your ICAM investment for alignment with the FICAM architecture relative to accounts, authentication, access control, and auditing capabilities. You should evaluate investment data architecture to prevent redundancies in identity data collection.
- **Control.** Use quality control and executive review to ensure your ICAM investments will deliver the projected benefits. You should make sure your agency’s investment aligns with your agency’s ICAM infrastructure. You should also oversee integration with enterprise ICAM services.
- **Evaluate.** Analyze whether the investments have delivered expected results while remaining cost effective. Investments should demonstrate return on investment (ROI) through the use of ICAM infrastructure security services. You should also determine opportunities to improve efficiency and update investments as enterprise ICAM capabilities mature.

While you complete CPIC activities and prepare budget submissions, include planning for PIV enablement and alignment with the FICAM architecture. As part of its adoption into the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA), the FICAM architecture was added and assigned a code in the Enterprise Architecture Segment Report (EASR). Your agency must code relevant ICAM costs to the FICAM code and report them as part of your budget submissions via the Exhibit 53.

The following table includes common ICAM-related cost categories that you can use to help determine and report your agency’s ICAM costs in an organized manner.

| <center> Cost Category </center> | <center> Description </center> |
|:---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **New User Identity Proofing** | Costs associated with identity proofing new users at the necessary level of assurance. |
| **Integration** | Integration costs from contractor services and additional software or hardware required for testing. |
| **Software** | Cost of software, including licenses and maintenance fees, that could be decommissioned or redeployed across all environments for development, testing, and production. |
| **PKI Software** | Licensing costs for PKI software as well as vendor maintenance fees to support all environments for development, testing, and production. |
| **Help Desk Calls** | Costs associated with the number of password-related calls received by an agency. |
| **IT Operations Services** | Costs of backups, monitoring, new development, and enhancements across all environments for development, testing, and production. |
