The main product of the Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process is the Exhibit 300, a document explaining the capital asset plan and business case. Your agency will write and review Exhibit 300s annually for both new and existing capital investments. The following sections describe the areas your agency will need to consider to construct an Exhibit 300 for your Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) program.

## Enterprise Approach for ICAM Investments
Traditionally, some agencies submit separate Exhibit 300 investment requests for various ICAM activities, such as PIV credentialing, Enterprise Single Sign On, physical access control systems (PACS) modernization, or enterprise identity management solutions. In budget submissions, you should coordinate your capital planning efforts across ICAM workstreams and Exhibit 300 business cases. This coordination helps reduce redundant ICAM investments across agency components or bureaus.

## Enterprise ICAM Solutions in CPIC Processes
Identify key criteria that align investments with ICAM. Communicate any changes to the relevant stakeholders and CPIC process participants.

The following list includes things you should consider in each phase of the standard CPIC process.

- **Preselect.** Assess the business needs and resource requirements for the investment. Investment business plans should state use of the PIV credential or authentication within the security planning and educate the Investment Review Board on ICAM requirements.
- **Select.** Select investments that best support the mission and approach. Review your ICAM investment for alignment with the FICAM Architecture relative to accounts, authentication, access control, and auditing capabilities. You should evaluate investment data architecture to prevent redundancies in identity data collection.
- **Control.** Use quality control and executive review to ensure your ICAM investments will deliver the projected benefits. You should make sure your agency’s investment aligns with your agency’s ICAM infrastructure. You should also oversee integration with enterprise ICAM services.
- **Evaluate.** Analyze whether the investments have delivered expected results while remaining cost effective. Investments should demonstrate return on investment (ROI) through the use of ICAM infrastructure security services. You should also determine opportunities to improve efficiency and update investments as enterprise ICAM capabilities mature.

The following table includes common ICAM-related cost categories that you can use to help determine and report your agency’s ICAM costs in an organized manner.

| <center> Cost Category </center> | <center> Description </center> |
|:---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **New User Identity Assurance** | Costs associated with identity proofing new users at the necessary identity assurance levels for enterprise users and public users (for mission applications). |
| **Integration** | Integration costs from contractor services and additional software or hardware required for testing. |
| **Software** | Cost of software, including licenses and maintenance fees, that could be decommissioned or redeployed across all environments for development, testing, and production. |
| **Service Desk** | Costs associated with the number of password-related calls received by an agency. |
| **IT Operations Services** | Costs of backups, monitoring, new development, and enhancements across all environments for development, testing, and production. |
| **Training** | Costs associated with training and creating or acquiring materials for new software and services installation, integration, maintenance, business processes, and end-user support. |
| **Policy Compliance** | Costs associated with bringing the system into compliance with ICAM policies. |


## Funding for ICAM Solutions
You may find challenges in funding and implementing the investment when equipment and services will likely be purchased centrally. Here are some approaches that other agencies have taken to fund their ICAM workstreams:

- **Incorporate costs into existing investments.** You don't need a separate investment for an implementation like an enterprise Physical Access Control System (PACS) solution. You can include the costs for PACS modernization into an existing business case.
- **Investment business case.** Create a new investment request to fund an ICAM workstream implementation at the enterprise level. This business case should include details of how the proposed investment would support the agency's mission.
- **Working capital fund.** Use a fund that can provide financing to agencies without annual appropriation by Congress for operations that generate receipts. This funding method works well for an agency that offers an enterprise PACS as a centralized service and has a cost recovery structure across the agency's bureaus or components.
