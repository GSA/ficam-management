- Strategic planning.
- Enterprise architecture (EA).
- Privacy and security.
- Budgeting.
- Portfolio management.
- Procurement and acquisition management of capital assets.

The pages that follow describe the CPIC process as it applies to your agency's Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) program.
