To communicate consistently and effectively, you should create a communications plan early in the program life cycle. A Communications Plan will outline the objectives, goals, themes and approach of the overall program.

Weâ€™ve provided you a summary of some common communications that you should include in your ICAM program below. 



| <center> Communication Description </center> | <center> Target Audience </center> | <center> Delivery Media </center> | 
|----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------:|:---------:|
| ICAM program awareness materials explaining key program features and milestones | User population | Brochures, posters, videos |
| ICAM program website containing resources for stakeholders and users | Various stakeholder groups | Website |
| Ad hoc updates for system rollout events and changes | User population | E-mail, newsletter bulletin | 
| Leadership briefing highlighting program objectives and status | Agency Leadership | Slide presentation, meeting | 
| Lessons learned workshops | ICAM implementers | Meeting, teleconference, webinar |

While creating your communications plan, you should analyze the stakeholders that make up your audience and tailor the message and delivery method in such a way that will produce the desired response. The goal of this plan is to keep stakeholders regularly informed and involved by providing appropriate and well-structured communications, ultimately helping to foster and maintain stakeholder support and reduce risk.

<h3><span>Lesson Learned</span></h3>
<p><span>Process or system changes that will impact users need to be communicated early and often in order to promote adoption. As many agencies learned when introducing the new PIV credential, employees and contractors needed to be made aware of the new requirements, processes, and their benefits before enrollments started to increase.</span></p>
