Welcome to the Program Management Playbook, where you will find general information and best practices to support management of an Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) Program, stakeholders, and other related topics. This playbook is for ICAM program managers who need agency-level planning guides to drive the overall success and adoption of ICAM services within their organization.

This playbook provides an overview of best practices related to agency governance structures, work streams and activities, and  stakeholder considerations.

### How is the playbook structured?

There are twelve 12 activities in this playbook. Each activity provides recommendations to perform that activity, and additional guidance including:

* Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
* Implementation tips
* Lessons learned
* Agency examples
* Privacy considerations

### How was the playbook developed?

The playbook was created using updated content that was previously found in the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Roadmap and Implementation Guidance v2.0.

### Where can I find additional content?

The FICAM Architecture provides a high-level overview of ICAM services, and a description of the services areas. Visit the <a href="https://arch.idmanagement.gov/" target="_blank"> FICAM Architecture</a> site for an overview of identity management and its role in broader FICAM.

### How can I contribute to this playbook?
