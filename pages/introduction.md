The ICAM Program Management Playbook explains how to plan and implement an Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) Program, as outlined in the <a href="https://arch.idmanagement.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Architecture</a>. In this playbook, youâ€™ll find content for ICAM program managers who need agency-level planning guides to drive adoption of ICAM services within their organizations, as well as how to govern the program, identify and communicate with stakeholders, manage risk, and other related topics.

This playbook answers the most common ICAM program organization and management questions, including:

- How can I establish governance to ensure ICAM alignment at the agency level?
- Who are my key ICAM stakeholders?
- What best practices support ICAM implementation?

The playbook is organized by sections, each of which describes an essential features of ICAM program management, including recommendations and lessons learned from agencies who have implemented ICAM programs.

The content for this playbook is based on the <a href="https://www.idmanagement.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/1171/uploads/FICAM_Roadmap_and_Implem_Guid.pdf" target="_blank">Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Roadmap and Implementation Guidance v2.0</a>.
