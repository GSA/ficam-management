To further promote the successful execution of the ICAM program initiatives, you may decide to assign separate workstreams in your ICAM PMO to employees who already have an active and steadfast involvement in a particular area outside of the program. A workstream task lead manages the day-to-day activities of his/her individual work stream and provides the ICAM PMO with critical and timely information related to the planning, development, deployment, and activities of their initiatives.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish PMO Governance Structure.** PMOs generally follow standardized project management policies, processes, and methods. Within ICAM, a PMO provides opportunities to share lessons learned both within an agency and across agencies. It may serve as an advisor to other agency offices or programs impacted by the ICAM program on addressing ICAM as appropriate within other agency-wide capabilities. An ICAM PMO acts as a single, centralized point of contact for the agency‘s ICAM program. The PMO is the primary authority for performing acquisition planning tasks and making procurement decisions. 

> The figure below represents a sample ICAM PMO structure. An agency should design its ICAM PMO structure in a way that fosters communication, coordinates efforts, and appropriately aligns with the agency‘s overall organizational structure.
