To further promote the successful execution of the ICAM program initiatives, you may decide to assign separate workstreams in your ICAM PMO to employees who already have an active and steadfast involvement in a particular area outside of the program. A workstream task lead manages the day-to-day activities of his/her individual work stream and provides the ICAM PMO with critical and timely information related to the planning, development, deployment, and activities of their initiatives.
