Welcome to the Program Management Playbook, where you will find general information and best practices to support management of an ICAM program, stakeholders, and other related topics. This playbook is intended for ICAM Program Managers who may be looking for agency-level planning considerations that drive the overall success and adoption of ICAM within their organization.

This playbook will provide you with an overview of best practices related to general agency governance, work streams and activities, and important stakeholders to consider.

### How is the playbook structured?

We developed this playbook into 12 activities. Within each activity, you will find recommendations to help you perform that activity and additional guidance, like frequently asked questions (FAQs), implementation tips, lessons learned, agency examples, and privacy considerations.

### How was the playbook developed?

The playbook was created using updated content that was previously found in the FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guidance v2.0. We hope that the new format encourages you and your agency to contribute to additional content to support the management of ICAM programs across the Federal government.

### Where can I find additional content?

The FICAM Architecture provides a high-level overview of identity management and a description of the services that deliver identity management capabilities. We recommend that you visit the <a href="https://arch.idmanagement.gov/" target="_blank"> FICAM Architecture</a> site to gain a basic understanding of identity management and how its role in broader federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM).
