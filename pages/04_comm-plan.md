A communication plan outlines a programâ€™s objectives, goals, themes, and approach. You should create a communication plan early in the program life cycle to communicate consistently and effectively with users and stakeholders.

The following table includes a summary of some common communication activities you should prioritize in your program.

| <center> Communication Description </center> | <center> Target Audience </center> | <center> Delivery Media </center> |
|----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------:|:---------:|
| Educational resources for stakeholders and users | Various stakeholder groups | Website (IDmanagement.gov) |
| Ad hoc updates for system rollout events and changes | User population | Email, newsletter bulletin |
| Leadership briefing highlighting program objectives and status | Agency leadership | Slide presentation, meeting |
| Messages from leadership | ICAM implementers | Memo, email |
| Awareness materials explaining key program features and milestones | User population | Social media, videos, brochures, posters |
| Lessons-learned workshops | ICAM implementers | Meeting, teleconference, webinar |
| Large-scale gathering (ICAM conference or all-hands) | ICAM implementers, user population | Meeting, teleconference, webinar |

You should tailor the messages and delivery methods to your program stakeholders. The goal of this plan is to inform and involve stakeholders by providing regular and well-structured communications, to foster and maintain stakeholder support and reduce risk.

As many agencies learned when introducing the new PIV credential, employees and contractors need to know about new requirements, processes, and their benefits  before enrollments increase." %}
