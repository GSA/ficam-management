All Federal agencies and programs that collect, retain, or use personal information are required to complete and maintain program documents to support these activities. Review the processes below to learn more about the processes you should complete so your agency can meet key privacy requirements:

### Apply the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPS)

ICAM programs involve the collecting, storing, sharing, and maintenance of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). As such, your agency must implement solutions that actively support privacy protections and the widely-recognized FIPPs. Under the Privacy Act, which is based on FIPPs, your agency is required to have certain processes and procedures governing the use of PII in place. You should first assess those processes and procedures and determine whether the implementation of an ICAM program constitutes a new use of PII that requires adjustment of existing processes and procedures.

The table below provides a description of each of the FIPPs and gives practical implementation considerations for applying them within an ICAM program.

#### FIPPS Implementation Considerations

| <center> FIPPS </center> | <center> Description </center> | <center> ICAM Considerations |
|:------------------------:|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Individual Participation** | Involve the individual in the process of using PII. As practicable, your agency should seek individual consent for the collection, use, dissemination, and maintenance of PII. Your agency should also provide mechanisms for appropriate access, correction, and redress regarding use of PII. | If your agency interacts with the public face-to-face and/or engages by paper/telephone you must recognize that there will be people who will not feel comfortable adopting technological processes. Your agency should continue to offer physical alternatives for processes that are not inherently technology-based. <br><br> Your agency should also provide redress mechanisms in accordance with the Privacy Act that allow people to report and correct information that is inaccurate, lost, or compromised and damages resulting from incorrect authentication or unauthorized access. Redress mechanisms help enhance confidence in the program and promote individual participation |
| **Transparency** | Be transparent with respect to the information they collect and share, and provide notice to the individual regarding collection, use, dissemination, and maintenance of PII. | A foundational principle in federal privacy law is that people have the right to know what information the government collects and retains about them and, to a great extent, the right to control how that information is being used. When building ICAM programs consider this principle and ensure the following prior to each occurrence of information collection and/or transmission: <br><br> • The user is clearly informed what information elements will be collected <br><br> • The user understands who will receive the information <br><br> • The user is clearly informed of how the information will be used <br><br> • The user must affirmatively choose to participate before any information is transmitted |
| **Data Minimization** | Only collect PII that is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish the specified purpose(s) and only retain PII for as long as is necessary to fulfill the specified purpose(s). | Your agency should only collect the information necessary to carry out ICAM business functions. Wherever possible, your agency should use assertions of an individual’s identity in lieu of identifying data elements. For example, if an application has an age limitation, the program should ask for proof of age rather than the exact birth date. You should also determine how long specific categories of information associated with ICAM processes will be retained and implement procedures for destruction of the information at the end of the retention period. |
| **Use Limitation** | Use PII solely for the purpose(s) specified in the notice. Sharing PII should be for a purpose compatible with the purpose for which the PII was collected. | The Privacy Act generally requires that once an individual consents to the collection of his information for a specific, stated purpose, that information can only be used for that purpose. This is particularly important to remember when considering the sharing of information between programs. If the programs have different purposes, such sharing will likely not be permissible without additional consent from the user. You should carefully consider this limitation when crafting your agency’s privacy ICAM program notices |
| **Security** | Protect PII (in all media) through appropriate security safeguards against risks such as loss, unauthorized access or use, destruction, modification, or unintended or inappropriate disclosure. | Your agency must ensure the security of information at all stages (collection, transmission, storage, destruction) in accordance with various legal and policy requirements (e.g., FISMA and OMB M-07-16).87 Examples of techniques for securing data are: <br><br> • Encryption <br><br> • Strong authentication procedures <br><br> • Time out functionality <br><br> • Minimum security controls to make information unusable by unauthorized individuals. |
| **Data Quality & Integrity** | Ensure that PII is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. | You agency should identify and implement means to ensure that PII is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete, including providing mechanisms for individuals to correct inaccuracies in their information. |
| **Accountability & Auditing** | Be accountable for complying with these principles, providing training to all employees and contractors who use PII. Agencies are also responsible for auditing the actual use of PII to demonstrate compliance with these principles and all applicable privacy protection requirements. | ICAM implementers should establish accountability measures to ensure that each of the FIPPs are appropriately applied and effectively protect users’ privacy. Such measures can include ICAM program audits and reviews by agency privacy and security officials. Agencies should address accountability for specific requirements, such as the M-07-16 requirement for annual certification of training for employees who handle PII. Clear accountability will promote confidence in ICAM programs. |

### Complete a System of Records Notice (SORN)

A notice published by an agency in the Federal Register to notify the public of a system of record, a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifier assigned to the individual. The SORN includes basic information about the system, including system name, categories of individuals covered by the system, and categories of records in the system and addresses the policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disposing of records in the system.

### Conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)

The process used to evaluate the potential ramifications to the protection of privacy within IT systems. The resulting document includes information related to the data in the system, access to the data, attributes of the data, and maintenance of administrative controls for protecting it. An agency must complete a PIA whenever a new system is being introduced or an existing system is substantially modified.

### Establishment of Redress Procedures

Procedures to allow an individual to review his record in an IT system upon request and permit the individual to request amendment of a record pertaining to him. In addition to enabling an agency to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, redress procedures also help enhance transparency, raise the awareness of the mission, and promote user confidence.

### Apply NIST 800-53 r4 (Appendix J) Privacy Controls

Based on FIPPs, the privacy controls outlined in NIST 800-53 r4 were built to help organization leaders determine the best ways to incorporate effective privacy protections and practices for programs and/or systems that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII.

Allowing users to file complaints and comments regarding an ICAM program and rectify this if their information is inaccurate, lost, or compromised will promote confidence in their interaction with the government." %}
