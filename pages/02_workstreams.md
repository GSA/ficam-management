A workstream is any one part of the whole of an agency’s business output. In the context of this playbook, workstreams are the individual projects within an Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) program.

Many of an ICAM program’s projects will overlap with various departments’ existing responsibilities. To promote the successful execution of your agency ICAM program’s initiatives, divide and assign each workstream to employees already actively involved in a related area outside of the ICAM program. Each workstream requires a task lead who manages the day-to-day activities of the workstream and provides the ICAM Program Management Office (PMO) with critical information about planning, development, deployment, and operations.

Thoughtful workstreams lead to the following outcomes:

- Enhanced efficiency.
- Streamlined overhead costs.
- Minimized redundancy of ICAM-related processes.
- Closer allignment with architecture and technical standards.
- Better communication and cooperation between interrelated programs.
- Consistent messaging to both internal and external stakeholders.
- Increased timeliness and accuracy of reporting.
- Greater agency-wide adoption.
- Reduced confusion and risk.

The following sections include descriptions of each ICAM workstream and its responsibilities:

- [Administrative Workstreams](#administrative-workstreams) - Tasks related to governance and program management.
- [Project Workstreams](#project-workstreams) - Tasks related to day-to-day ICAM operations.

See the [Agency Example](#agency-example) section for a graphic depicting a sample ICAM program's administrative workstreams.

## Administrative Workstreams

Each administrative workstream is responsible for ICAM governance and both intra- and inter-agency communication.

| <center> Workstream </center> | <center> Description </center> |
|:-----------------------------:|--------------------------------|
|**Outreach & Communications** | Program Communications Plan development and execution, including: <br><br> • Defining communication message types, media, target audience, and timing. <br><br> • Communicating ICAM program concepts, activities, and progress to promote support for the implementation of improved ICAM capabilities. |
| **Policy** | Program policy and standard operating procedure development and finalization. |
| **Budget** | Program budget development, management, monitoring, and reporting. The Budget Workstream works closely with the agency’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer during the budget development and submission cycles. |
| **Performance Management** | Program performance and metrics tracking, management, and reporting. |

## Project Workstreams

Each project workstream is responsible for ICAM processes and systems related to various components within the program.

| <center> Workstream </center> | <center> Description </center> |
|:-----------------------------:|--------------------------------|
| **Identity Management** | Digital identity data management. This includes modernizing the management of digital identities, such as HR modernization, in accordance with FICAM initiatives. |
| **Credential Management** | Credential lifecycle management activities. You may identify separate workstreams for various credential types, including agency Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards and local facility access cards. |
| **Physical Access** | Physical access control, including modernization efforts and security priorities in accordance with FICAM and Interagency Security Committee (ISC) initiatives. |
| **Logical Access** | Logical access control, including access policies, provisioning, and authentication technologies. |
