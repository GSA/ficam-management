> “The interwoven technical architecture of the Federal Government creates complexity in managing access to resources, safeguarding networks, and protecting information...each agency must harmonize its enterprise-wide approach to governance, architecture, and acquisition.” - *OMB Memorandum M-19-17*

An agency ICAM program requires leadership to manage and oversee the program’s complex requirements, engage and collaborate with stakeholders, and apply proven risk management strategies to support the agency.
