A stakeholder is an individual or organization that is either actively involved in a program or who might be affected by the program’s execution or completion. It’s critical that you, identify all stakeholders, and not just those who may be positively affected by the project, in order to understand the needs, responsibilities, and potential impacts of program decisions. 

We’ve identified key ICAM stakeholders at the federal and agency level. We’ve also included the approach for managing and engaging stakeholders to support your ICAM programs’ success.  Depending on your agency and mission needs, you may have other stakeholders not identified below.

The following checklist shows government-wide external stakeholders and agency stakeholders you should identify.
