Agencies are required to perform a risk assessment on a system to determine the extent of potential threats associated with it. Risk assessments assist agencies in determining the proper security mechanisms for information systems based on their level of risk. 

According to NIST SP 800-30, Risk management is the process that allows IT managers to balance the costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission capability by protecting the information systems and data that support their organization‘s mission.

ICAM solutions are capable of supporting innovative approaches for IT risk management. ICAM implementations also offer the ability to support required information system security controls using common services for the entire organization, significantly streamlining the accreditation process. Below, you will find more information about the ways in which ICAM systems impact and are impacted by IT security and risk management processes.

|------------------------|
|Implementing proactive security controls, such as those offered by enterprise ICAM services, can save an agency money through risk avoidance. The average organizational cost of a data breach in 2010 was $7.2 million, an average of $214 per compromised account. Proactive measures cost organizations significantly less, with the average cost for detection and escalation being $13 per record and $51 during ex-post response. |

### Risk Management Framework for Information Systems

Information systems implemented as part of an agency's ICAM program must meet all relevant Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements, including application of the IT Risk Management Framework (RMF) defined in NIST SP-800-37. The RMF is a security life cycle approach designed to help agencies build information security capabilities into their information systems, better monitor the real-time security status of those systems, and provide relevant information to agency leadership to enable risk-based decisions associated with their operation.

The RMF includes 6 steps, which an agency must apply to its ICAM systems in order to select, implement, asses, and authorize the appropriate system security controls and adequately monitor the effectiveness of those controls to support responsibility and accountability in the overall security of the system.

| <center> FAQ </center> |
|------------------------|
| **What is the difference between the Certification and Accreditation (C&A) process and the Risk Management Framework (RMF)?**   
The six-step RMF fundamentally transformed the previous C&A process to allow an organization to track the security state of an information system on an ongoing basis and maintain the security authorization for the system over time. The C&A process was not an on-going, multi-step approach like the RMF life cycle process. This life cycle gives agencies the flexibility to alter, enhance, or reassess the security controls employed in their information systems continuously and easily. |

<br>

The 6 steps in the RMF cycle are summarized in the following table. The RMF framework allows agencies to move from and between steps as needed and allocate resources to each step as they deem appropriate. However, equal emphasis should be placed on each step.

<br>

| <center> Step </center> | <center> Step Description </center> | <center> Objectives </center> |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <center> 1 </center> | CATEGORIZE Information System | • Categorize information and information systems based on mission and business objectives of the agency <br/><br/>• Describe each information system, including: full name with acronym, location of the system, version number, types of information held in the system, system owner, and other specific agency requirements <br/><br/>• Register the information system within specified program offices |
| <center> 2 </center> | SELECT Security Controls | • Select the appropriate security controls for the information system and document the controls in the security plan <br/><br/> • Develop a continuous monitoring strategy to determine the ongoing effectiveness of security controls and any changes to information systems <br/><br/> • Review the proposed security controls; ensure that the security plan has identified any possible risk to the agency |
| <center> 3 </center> | IMPLEMENT Security Controls | • Implement security controls from the security plan (created in step 2) <br/><br/> •	Document the implementation of the security controls in the security plan |
| <center> 4 </center> | ACCESS Security Controls | •	Create and approve a security assessment plan of the security controls and ensure assessors follow the documented procedures in the plan <br/><br/> • Document any problems or recommendations from the assessment in an assessment report and adjust appropriate security controls, if needed |
| <center> 5 </center> | AUTHORIZE Information Systems | •	Create a plan of action based on findings from the security assessment report; when completed, submit to the authorizing agency official for review <br/><br/> •	The authorizing official reviews and determines the risk to the organizational operations, such as mission or assets |
| <center> 6 </center> | MONITOR Security Controls | •	Review and determine the security impact of any changes to the information system <br/><br/> • Make updates to the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of actions as needed during the continuous monitoring process <br/><br/> •	Following the monitoring strategy set forth, report the security status on a continual basis |
