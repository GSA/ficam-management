The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 introduced the Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC). CPIC supports alignment of investments to the agency's mission and supports business needs while reducing risks and increasing returns throughout the investment's life cycle. The CPIC process as whole integrates strategic planning, enterprise architecture (EA), privacy, security, budgeting, portfolio management, procurement, and acquisition management of capital assets.

The primary product of the CPIC process is the Exhibit 300. Exhibit 300s are constructed and reviewed on an annual basis for both new and existing capital investments.

Traditionally, agencies have submitted separate Exhibit 300 investment requests for various ICAM activities (e.g., HSPD-12, E-authentication). However, in future budget submissions, agencies may consider coordinating their capital planning efforts closely across individual ICAM projects and Exhibit 300 business cases. The goal of this coordination effort is to ensure alignment throughout the organization to reduce or eliminate redundant ICAM investments across agency components/bureaus. 

In addition to updating the agency's approach to its ICAM investments, agencies should also work to incorporate ICAM requirements into its CPIC and investment request processes. This will require identifying key criteria for an investment to be considered aligned with FICAM, incorporating that criteria into CPIC processes and guidance, and communicating any changes to the relevant stakeholders and CPIC process participants.

Furthermore, collaboration between all relevant stakeholders during each phase of the CPIC process is critical to ensure that the overlapping elements of different ICAM activities are addressed. The following table highlights several of the key ICAM considerations relevant to each phase of the standard CPIC process.

<br>

| CPIC Phase| <center> Phase Objectives </center> | <center> ICAM Considerations <center> |
|:-----------:|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Pre-Select** | Assess the business needs and resource requirements for the investment | Investment business plans should state use of the PIC card or authentication within the security planning. Educate Investment Review Board on ICAM requirements |
| **Select** | Ensure the selection of investments that best supports the mission and approach | • Review investment for alignment with the FICAM architecture relative to accounts, authentication, access control, and auditing capabilities <br/><br/>• Investment data architecture should be evaluated to guard against the redundant collection of identity data |
| **Control** | Take actions to ensure investments will deliver the projected benefits through quality control and executive review | • Ensure the investment is properly integrated and aligned with the agency's ICAM infrastructure <br/><br/>• Oversee development of investment and integration with enterprise ICAM services |
| **Evaluate** | Evaluate and analyze if investments have delivered what was expected, while remaining cost effective | • Investment should document and demonstrate return on investment (ROI) realized through use of ICAM infrastructure security services <br/><br/>• Determine opportunities to improve efficiency and update investment as enterprise ICAM capabilities mature |

Agencies need to include planning for PIV-enablement and alignment with the FICAM architecture when completing capital planning activities and preparing their budget submissions. As part of its adoption into the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA), the FICAM architecture was added and assigned a code in the Enterprise Architecture Segment Report (EASR). Agencies must code relevant ICAM costs to the FICAM code and report them as part of their budget submissions via the Exhibit 53. The following table provides a summary of multiple common ICAM-related cost categories, which an agency can leverage to help determine and report their ICAM costs in an organized manner.

<br>

| Cost Category | <center> Description </center> |
|:---------------: |-------------|
| **New User Identity Proofing** | Costs associated with proofing the identity of new users at the necessary level of assurance |
| **Integration** | Integration costs from contractor services and additional software/hardware required for integration and testing |
| **Software** | Cost of software including licenses and maintenance fees that could be decommissioned or redeployed across all environments for development, testing, and production |
| **PKI Software** | Licensing costs for PKI software as well as vendor maintenance fees to support all environments for development, testing, and production.
| **Help Desk Calls** | Costs associated with the number of password related calls received by an agency
| **IT Operations Services** | Costs of backups, monitoring, new development, enhancements, etc. across all environments for development, testing, and productions
| **Training** | Costs associated with training and creating/acquiring materials for new software and services installation, integration, maintenance, business processes, and end users support |
| **Policy Compliance** | Costs associated with bringing the system into compliance with applicable ICAM policies |
