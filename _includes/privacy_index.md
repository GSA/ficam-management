# Privacy Considerations
-----------------------------------------

ICAM programs have significant privacy implications for federal agencies and must be treated accordingly. These implications must be carefully considered by agencies to minimize potential privacy risks, while still providing the security intended for the identity management systems (IDMS). 

This section introduces the Fair Information Principles (FIPPs) and discusses how they can be appropriately integrated into an agency's ICAM program. The information and guidance presented in this section is intended to assist agencies in providing answers to several common ICAM-related privacy questions, including: 

* What are the [Fair Information Practice Principles](../fipps/) and how do they apply to my agency's ICAM program?
<br>

* What [processes](../support/) does my agency need to complete in order to meet applicable privacy requirements?
