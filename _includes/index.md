# Program Management Playbook
----------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Program Management Playbook, where you will find general information and best practices to support management of an ICAM program, stakeholders, and other related topics. This playbook is intended for ICAM Program Managers who may be looking for agency-level planning considerations that drive the overall success and adoption of ICAM within their organization.

The content in this guide heavily leverages and replaces guidance that existed in Chapter 6 of the *FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guide v2.0*. 

<br>

**How should I structure my ICAM Program?**
<br>

[The Program Organization and Management](../program-guides/prog-mgmt/index/) section will provide you with an overview of best practices related to general agency governance, work streams and activities, and important stakeholders to consider.

<br>

**How do I measure ICAM Program success?**
<br>

[The Performance Reporting](../program-guides/perf-rept/) section provides performance and metrics considerations. While reporting metrics can often measure compliance rather than performance, the current ICAM-specific list of the FY16 FISMA metrics serve as a foundation for agency measurement.

<br>

**Is ICAM Program Management the same as ICAM Governance?**
<br>

[Program Management](../program-guides/prog-mgmt/3_management/) as outlined in this playbook focuses on supporting the general lifecycle methodologies that agencies employ to plan and execute programs. [Governance](../program-guides/prog-mgmt/1_governance/), as defined in the FICAM Architecture, focuses on administering capabilities necessary to ensure successful service operations. Successful ICAM Program Management within an enterprise involves the successful deployment of Governance Services, as outlined in the FICAM Architecture Services Framework.

This playbook will be periodically updated to provide additional information based on your feedback.
