# Program Organization and Management
---------------------
ICAM is a key enabler across the federal enterprise and within specific agency programs and
mission areas; therefore, it is imperative that federal agencies properly organize and manage ICAM efforts. This section provides guidance on how an agency can establish effective governance structures, collaborate with stakeholders, provide program management, and report performance to executive leadership to ensure that these programs are implemented successfully across the organization and to minimize any negative impact of ICAM on the agencyâ€˜s mission.

The information and guidance presented in this section is intended to assist agencies in providing
answers to several common program organization and management questions, including:
<br>

* How can I [establish governance](../1_governance) to ensure ICAM alignment at the agency level?
<br>

* What groups are considered [ICAM stakeholders?](../2_stakeholders/)
<br>

* What are the [best practices](../3_management/) for supporting implementation of individual ICAM projects?
