In addition to setting up an ICAM governance structure, an agency needs to establish a mechanism for supporting execution and operations of the projects and workstreams within the ICAM program. This section examines a Program Management Office (PMO) as one possible alternative for providing ICAM program support; however, an agency should evaluate potential program management alternatives and select the option that best fits its needs.

An ICAM PMO serves a complementary role to the ESC and while establishing both an ESC and a PMO may not be strictly necessary, larger organizations may see the need to separate governance and operational responsibility within their ICAM program. A PMO helps ensure that the individual projects and investments that comprise the ICAM program run smoothly and achieve the expected results within the defined budgetary and schedule constraints.

The PMO will typically be responsible for the following functions:
<br>

* Planning and coordinating implementation efforts across various ICAM stakeholders and component programs (e.g., credentialing, physical access control, logical access control, personnel security, etc.)
* Maintaining an enterprise ICAM perspective to ensure alignment of all component programs with organizational objectives
* Serving as a centralized point of contact for ICAM questions, issues, and concerns
* Planning for and securing program funding to execute ICAM capabilities
* Handling communications and outreach to both internal and external stakeholders
* Managing program risks and issues to resolution across agency office/component/bureau boundaries

|<center> FAQ </center> |
|-----------------------|
|**What is the difference between an Executive Steering Committee (ESC) and a Program Management Office (PMO)?** ESCs traditionally provide top-down leadership support and guidance across the programs within an agency and PMOs provide operational support for the day-to-day execution of a specific implementation. |

<br>

### Workstreams

To further promote the successful execution of the ICAM program initiatives, an ICAM PMO may decide to assign separate workstreams to individuals who already have an active and steadfast involvement in a particular area outside of the program. A workstream task lead manages the day-to-day activities of his/her individual workstream and provides the ICAM PMO with critical and timely information related to the planning, development, deployment, and activities of their initiatives.

<br>

### *Administrative Workstreams*

| <center> Workstream </center> | <center> Description </center> |
|:---------------------------------:|------------------------------------|
| **Outreach & Communications**| Responsible for devleoping and executing the ICAM program’s Communications Plan, including: <br><br> • Defining communication message types, media, target audience, and timing <br><br> • Communicating ICAM program concepts, activities, and progress to promote support for the implementation of improved ICAM capabilities |
| **Policy** | Responsible for setting the direction for the ICAM program and developing or finalizing all policies and standard operating procedures related to the ICAM program. |
| **Budget** | Responsible for developing, managing, monitoring, and reporting on the ICAM program budget. The Budget Workstream will have key interfaces with an agency’s OCFO during the budget development and submission cycles. |
| **Peformance Management** | Responsible for tracking, managing, and reporting on overall ICAM program performance and metrics. |

<br>

### *Project Workstreams*

| <center> Workstream </center> | <center> Description </center> |
|:---------------------------------:|------------------------------------|
| **Identity Management** | Responsible for ICAM processes and systems related to the management of digital identity data. This includes management and oversight of efforts to modernize the management of digital identities, such as HR modernization, in accordance with FICAM initiatives. |
| **Credential Management** | Responsible for ICAM processes and systems related to credential lifecycle management activities. Separate workstreams may be identified for various credential types, including agency PIV cards and local facility access cards. |
| **Physical Access** | Responsible for ICAM processes and systems related to physical access control, including modernization efforts in accordance with the FICAM initiatives. |
| **Logical Access** | Responsible for ICAM processes and systems related to logical access control, including modernization efforts in accordance with the FICAM initiatives. |

<br>

PMOs generally follow standardized project management policies, processes, and methods. Within ICAM, a PMO provides opportunities to share lessons learned both within an agency and across agencies. It may serve as an advisor to other agency offices or programs impacted by the ICAM program on addressing ICAM as appropriate within other agency-wide capabilities. 

Additionally, an ICAM PMO acts as a single, centralized point of contact for the agency‘s ICAM program. Finally, the PMO is the primary authority for performing acquisition planning tasks and making procurement decisions. As a result, an ICAM PMO can offer an agency the following benefits:
<br>

* Enhanced efficiency
* Streamlined overhead costs
* Minimized redundancy of ICAM-related processes
* Validated alignment with architecture and technical standards
* Fostered communication and cooperation between interrelated programs
* Consistent messaging to both internal and external stakeholders
* Timely and accurate reporting
* Minimized confusion
* Facilitated agency-wide adoption
* Minimized risks
<br>

The figure below represents a sample ICAM PMO structure. An agency should design its ICAM PMO structure in a way that fosters communication, coordinates efforts, and appropriately aligns with the agency‘s overall organizational structure.

### Program Communications

In order to communicate consistently and effectively, a Communications Plan should be developed early in the program life cycle for programs such as ICAM. A Communications Plan will outline the objectives, goals, themes and approach of the overall program.

The following table provides a summary of some of the common communications that an agency might incorporate as part of its ICAM program.

<br>

| <center> Communication Description </center> | <center> Target Audience </center> | <center> Delivery Media </center> |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ICAM program awareness materials explaining key program features and milestones | User population | Brochures, posters, videos |
| ICAM program website containing resources for stakeholders and users | Various stakeholder groups | Website |
| Ad hoc updates for system rollout events and changes | User population | E-mail, newsletter bulletin |
| Leadership briefing highlighting program objectives and status | Agency Leadership | Slide presentation, meeting |
| Lessons learned workshops | ICAM implementers | Meeting, teleconference, webinar |
| Messages from Leadership | ICAM implementers | Memo, email |
| ICAM conference or All-Hands | ICAM implementers, user population | Meeting, teleconference, webinar |

<br>

When creating a Communications Plan, agencies should analyze the stakeholders that make up their audience and tailor the message and delivery media in such a way that will produce the desired response. The goal of this plan is to keep stakeholders regularly informed and involved by providing appropriate and well-structured communications, ultimately helping to foster and maintain stakeholder support and reduce risk.

<br>

| <center> Lessons Learned </center> |
|------------------------------------|
| Process or system changes that will impact users need to be communicated early and often in order to promote adoption. As many agencies learned when introducing the new PIV credential, employees and contractors needed to be made aware of the new requirements, processes, and their benefits before enrollments started to increase. |

### Program Risk Management

Risk management involves the identification of policies, procedures, and practices, as well as the analysis, assessment, control, and avoidance of threats to the continuing efficiency, profitability and success of program operations. proactive risk management is paramount within an agency‘s ICAM program. This requires the involvement of the entire program management team and active maintenance of issues. Other typical characteristics of a successful risk management program include:
<br>

* Stakeholders at all levels within a project can identify a risk
* Processes exist to analyze, prioritize, and determine mitigation approaches for identified risks
* Procedures are in place for assigning owner(s) of a risk and defining risk ownership responsibilities
* A defined escalation path exists for flagging and resolving risks up to and including executive leadership, as necessary
* There is an ability to track the resolution efforts and their effectiveness
* Report on risk status to organizational leadership
<br>

ICAM implementers should develop a Risk Management Plan that defines the way risks are measured for the ICAM program, provides a process for identification and appropriate response, and assigns roles and responsibilities for various stages in the process. Tools are available commercially to help manage and track risks for a program. ICAM implementers should determine if their agency has risk management tools that could be leveraged within the ICAM program.

Another leading practice in ICAM Risk Management is the use of a Risk Registry (sometimes referred to as a Risk Log), which aides in managing, assigning and tracking risk events. The Risk Registry usually includes the description of the risk event, the date that the event occurred, how the event was resolved, whether the resolution was effective, and the owner of the event. Review and updating of the Risk Registry should be incorporated into ongoing management processes. 

The following table summarizes some of the common risks faced within an agency ICAM program and sample mitigation approaches.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| If agency plans and budgets do not include ICAM activities, adequate funding may not be available for modernization efforts, the agency will not be able to meet requirements and deadlines for the FICAM architecture | • Develop consolidated ICAM business case and funding request to secure funding beginning in FY12 <br/><br/> • Communicate funding needs to the agency OCFO and explore existing funding sources within the agency <br/><br/>• Determine if internal funding can be routed to ICAM efforts, for example, working capital |
| If the agency’s ICAM transition plan does not gain support and adoption at the Assistant/Deputy Secretary level, including required compliance, the agency will not receive coordination and support from the necessary stakeholders in order to move forward with implementation | • Support institution of governance structure for ICAM (to include the ESC) <br/><br/>• Develop and implement Communications Plan |
| If the agency doesn’t meet the scheduled transition activity milestone dates, funding for ICAM and other agency systems may be impacted | Based on agency FICAM architecture analysis, provide realistic completion targets for ICAM activities to OMB in the ICAM Transition Plan template |
| If the bureaus/components fail to adopt enterprise ICAM services in a timely manner, overall agency ICAM implementation and compliance will be delayed | Dedicate ICAM program management resources and program funding to gain stakeholder buy-in and support bureau/component-level implementation requirements and efforts |
| If the agency is unable to staff dedicated resources with the necessary technical knowledge, the agency will be unable to successfully execute technical implementation and the program schedule will lag | • Leverage cross-agency ICAM expertise via working groups and outreach in order to supplement staff knowledge <br/><br/>• Incorporate staff augmentation in the ICAM acquisition plan in order to ensure necessary skill sets |
| If the ICAM effort is unable to gain acceptance by the user population, the agency will not be able to meet FICAM requirements and deadlines | Dedicate additional ICAM program management resources and program funding to increase the communication effort and promote awareness. |
| If the ICAM solution vendor(s) goes out of business, the agency may experience program delays or incur additional costs to migrate to new solutions | • Include supply chain risk management in ICAM program Acquisition Plan and identify alternative solution component sources. Where possible, use approved vendors and products from established acquisition vehicles <br/><br/>• Include activities for compiled software escrow and source code escrow |
