A stakeholder is an individual or organization that is either actively involved in a program or who might be affected by the program's execution or completion. It is critical to identify all stakeholders, and not just those who may be positively affected by the project, in order to understand the needs, responsibilities, and potential impacts of program decisions. 

This section identifies key ICAM stakeholders, both at the [government-wide level](#government) and the [agency level](#agency). It then introduces approaches for [managing and engaging stakeholders](#strategies) to support ICAM program success.

<br>

### <a name="government"></a>Government-Wide Stakeholders

An early step in developing the original FICAM architecture was identifying the stakeholders related to ICAM. The following tables provide an overview of the stakeholders who were identified as part of this process. The tables list many of the federal stakeholders for ICAM, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of non-federal stakeholders.

The tables are broken down into 7 types government-wide of stakeholders:

* [Federal Governance Bodies](#governance)
* [Internal Standards Body](#standards)
* [External Industry Guidance and Standards Bodies](#guidance)
* [Internal ICAM Service Providers](#internal)
* [External Service Providers](#external)
* [Internal Service Customers](#incustomers)
* [External Service Customers](#extcustomers)

### <a name="agency"></a>Agency-Level Stakeholders

The table is not intended to be an exhaustive list of agency-level stakeholders for all federal organizations, but rather to highlight the most common groups that are involved in or impacted by ICAM implementations.

### <a name="strategies"></a>Stakeholder Management Strategies

Stakeholder management, as it relates to ICAM, involves coordination, collaboration, and communication with numerous entities within the agency. Each of these entities often has a distinct mission requirement and performs a specific set of duties in support of the overall agency mission. These stakeholders will have different viewpoints that may conflict with one another or the overarching ICAM program objectives. Furthermore, decisions made in one program area may impact another. 

This section presents some high-level considerations for involving stakeholders and promoting collaboration across an agency‘s ICAM portfolio to help overcome many of the challenges typically associated with ICAM.

Collaboration is usually achieved through the development of expert problem-solving teams, such as working groups that are established to address issues and present solutions. The success of these groups is heavily reliant on participation and involvement from stakeholders across the program in order to ensure that all requirements are considered. 

Within an agency‘s ICAM program, for example, each bureau/component might assemble an interdisciplinary working group responsible for expressing the concerns and interests of its business and system owners and users. These representatives work with the group to incorporate their needs into agency-wide program capabilities and requirements. Working groups are also used as a forum for sharing implementation lessons learned across bureaus/components or individual programs in order to reduce overall ICAM program risk and increase speed and efficiency in implementation.

In addition to working groups, an agency may choose to stand up smaller focus groups or tiger teams for the purpose of resolving specific program issues or providing direct support for implementation. This technique helps improve stakeholder buy-in associated with enterprise approaches and services by promoting better understanding and a sense of inclusion and ownership in the program. It also improves consistency across an agency‘s ICAM implementation.

For example, an agency‘s ICAM program management staff could leverage small focus groups with expertise in the agency‘s enterprise ICAM program and tools to consult with and support implementation efforts at the bureau/component level.
