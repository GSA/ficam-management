In order to ensure that ICAM programs at the agency level are compliant, each agency should have a formal governance structure, either by leveraging an existing program structure or by establishing new governance as necessary. This structure is responsible for aligning and consolidating the agency‘s various ICAM investments, monitoring these programs for alignment with organizational objectives, and ensuring broad awareness and understanding. Program governance should also establish goals, mission priorities, organization, accountability, metrics, and management controls within an agency

Establishing a formal governance structure within a federal agency refers to both the creation and assignment of a specific group or entity to provide oversight and management, and development and enforcement of agency-specific policies, processes, and performance measures. The governance needs to be structured in a way that facilitates coordination between the Department and bureau/component level and promotes stakeholder buy-in. Program Governance involves identifying individuals, such as an Executive Sponsor, to champion the ICAM program and establishing coordinated governance groups at the Department and bureau/component levels, such as an ICAM Executive Steering Committee (ESC).

### Executive Steering Committee
The ESC is chartered by the agency‘s executive leadership to govern and align the ICAM program with its agency‘s mission. Typically, the ESC is comprised of departmental heads, bureau/component leadership, business owners, and application owners. The ESC‘s charter should specify the group‘s authority to enforce changes, when necessary, to align ICAM technology, policy and execution with the agency‘s overall mission.

An ESC provides an agency with the ability to resolve many of the internal issues common to ICAM by employing a top-down approach for managing implementation. For example, gaining the support and buy-in necessary to ensure wide-scale enterprise adoption is often difficult given the broad reach and technical nature of ICAM. ESCs help mitigate this risk by providing end- users with a consistent message from their senior executives on how ICAM solutions can streamline access to resources that support their mission work. Additionally, many of the ESC participants are leaders within the stakeholder community, and as such, facilitate collaboration between the diverse groups that contribute to successful ICAM implementation. Properly chartered, an ESC will establish performance measurement and accountability mechanisms to ensure that ICAM implementations comply with federal laws and regulations and fulfill the desired goals and objectives.

The role and responsibilities of each agency‘s ESC are typically governed by its charter. The following list describes some of the typical responsibilities that might be assigned to an ESC:

*  Provide a means through which changes to the ICAM program or disputes between ICAM and individual program offices are resolved
*  Provide direction and counsel to the ICAM Program Management Office (PMO), if applicable
*  Ensure proper resource allocation to ICAM programs and projects
*  Review and approve the program business architecture
*  Provide input for, or participate in, the critical development stages of the ICAM program
*  Take responsibility for overall stakeholder management to include internal and external stakeholders
*  Provide strategic guidance for cost, schedule, performance, and technical solutions to ensure program success
*  Review post-implementation evaluations to ensure that forecasted benefits and outcomes of the ICAM program are met
*  Provide program status information to oversight organizations, such as the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Inspector General (OIG), and Government Accountability Office (GAO), upon request
*  Establish collaboration to provide guidance, identity common agency challenges, identify best practices, and share solutions

### Bureau/Component Governance
Some agencies are made up of subgroups, typically called bureaus or components, which operate in a decentralized manner. For agencies with this dynamic, it may be beneficial to create a governance structure at the bureau/component level by way of an interdisciplinary team. This team should be authorized and recognized by department-level leadership to enhance communication and promote cohesion among the various subgroups within an agency. 

The mission of the bureau/component interdisciplinary team is to provide ICAM-related recommendations to the department‘s ESC and help drive the success of the ICAM program. These teams are typically comprised of working-level roles and employ a bottom up approach for managing implementation. An interdisciplinary team at the bureau/component level plays an important risk mitigation role by providing insight into the implementation effort from a functional point of view. This information helps the ESC understand the impact certain decisions may have on program executors and ultimately promote buy-in across various stakeholders.
