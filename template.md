Pages use markdown formatting for content.  You can review markdown formatting and a quick three-minute guide by browsing to the Mastering Markdown guide from Github: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

This template is for submitting NEW pages to the site.   

For guidance, pages should be brief to reduce scrolling by users, be written in Plain Language, and use bullets, lists and images.  Paragraphs should be short.

Samples are provided below for the formats used on this site.

# This is a top level header
## This is a second level header
### This is a third level header
#### This is a fourth level header

Start your page with a top level header.

# Type your header here

Include a brief description of the purpose of the page.

As you add sub-sections, you can create links from the top by creating a linked list like this:

- [Sub Section1](#sub-section1)
- [Sub Section2](#sub-section2)

## Sub Section1

Italics use underscores.  This is _italics_.
Bold uses asterisks.  This is **bold**.

Bullets use the dash, followed by two spaces. 

-  Bullet 1
-  Bullet 2

Numbered lists can use numbers, and the lists will automatically increment for you.

1. Numbered List 1
1. Numbered List 2


## Sub Section2

To reference an image, you will need to upload the image file to the /img/ folder on the github repository.  Here is a sample for referencing an image:

![This is what I want a screen reader to say for 508 compliance]({{site.baseurl}}/img/thisisthesampleimagefile.png)

To link to another page that already exists, 

[This is what I want my link to say]({{site.baseurl}}/insertlink/)
